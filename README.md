# Introduction

The project is part of a Full Stack CodeInstitute course. This is Milestone Project 1. This project was to create a website for a local, family run gym that is looking to reach out to new potential members in order to encourage more visits and memberships.

# User Experience Design
## User Stories
### First Time Visitors
* What would I want to see as a first time visitor?
  1. Understand where the gym is located.
  2. Learn what type of gym-goer the gym is catered for, whether that's CrossFit type workouts, bodybuilding or cardio based workouts.
  3. In light of COVID-19, how visitors can maintain their safety and what measures have been put into place to mitigate risks.
  4. Any other facilities on site that would be of benefit to me.
### Returning Visitors
* What would I want to see as a returning visitor?
  1. If I liked the look of the website upon first visit and liked the sound of the gym I'd want to know more about the prices.
  2. I'd like to know if there are regular classes each day that I'd be interested in and what the schedule is.
  3. What the opening times are and if this fits my working patterns.
  4. How to get in contact with the gym.
### Frequent Users
* What would I want to see as a frequent visitor?
  1. If the timetable has changed regarding classes.
  2. If there are any new personal trainers that have joined the team.
  3. A new featured product that I may be interested in.

# Features
## Current Features
Some of the key features incorporated into the website include responsiveness for multiple screen sizes and orientations. A fixed-top navigation bar to allow easy navigation been the page sections and the content, which also collapses on smaller screen sizes. Certain objects are also removed on mobile views to reduce the amount of scrolling required, such as reducing the number of gallery images.
