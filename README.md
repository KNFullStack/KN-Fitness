# Introduction

The project is part of a Full Stack Developer course run by CodeInstitute. This is Milestone Project 1. This project was to create a website for a local, family run gym that is looking to reach out to new potential members in order to encourage more visits and memberships.

## KN Fitness Responsive Website

http://techsini.com/multi-mockup/index.php replace images below with this.

A mockup of the website can be seen below:

# User Experience Design
## User Stories
### First Time Visitors
* What would I want to see as a first time visitor?
  1. Understand where the gym is located and if that's a suitable location based on where I live, or my commute.
  2. Learn what type of gym-goer the gym is catered for, whether that's CrossFit type workouts, bodybuilding or cardio based workouts.
  3. In light of COVID-19, how visitors can maintain safety and what measures are in place to mitigate risks.
  4. Any other facilities on site that would be of benefit to me.
  6. The ability to easily navigate the website to find the information that is important.
### Returning Visitors
* What would I want to see as a returning visitor?
  1. I'd want to know more about the prices.
  2. I'd like to know if there are regular classes each day that I'd be interested in and what the schedule is.
  3. What the opening times are and if this fits my working patterns.
  4. How to get in contact with the gym.
  5. If there are any social media accounts to check out the gym further.
### Frequent Users

  4. If there have been new images added to the gallery.

## Design
### Colors
The main colors for the website are black (#000000), white (#FFFFFF) and pastel-like red color (#B91546).
### Typography
The text throughout the website uses the **Roboto** font, while the headers use the **Bebas Neue** font.
### Images
The logo that has been created was made using [myfreelogomaker](https://myfreelogomaker.com/). Having the logo visible on all devices is important and therefore is shown on all devices on the left hand side of the navigation bar.
### Wireframes
Wireframes can be found in the "assets" folder. It contains a design for the desktop and mobile version of the website.
See links for PDF's below:
1. [Mobile Wireframe](/assets/readme-content/wireframe-mobile.pdf)
2. [Desktop Wireframe](/assets/readme-content/wireframe-desktop.pdf)

### Design Deviations
## Limitations

# Features
## Current Features
Some of the key features incorporated into the website include responsiveness for multiple screen sizes and orientations. A fixed top navigation bar to allow easy navigation between the page sections and the content, this helps reduce the amount of scrolling needed to get to different sections, especially on mobile. This navigation bar collapses on smaller screen sizes. Certain objects are also removed on smaller viewing windows to reduce the amount of scrolling required, such as reducing the number of gallery images.

## Future Features

# Technologies
Technologies used are as follows.
## Languages
* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

   * Used as a storage location for the website's content, including code and assets.
7. [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
   * An online IDE used to write and test code that is written.
8. [Techsini](http://techsini.com/multi-mockup/index.php)
   * Used to generate the mockup image in this README file, see above.
